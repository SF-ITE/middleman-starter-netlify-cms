  In 1976, Atari hammered out a deal with the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid
  Transit System (BART), allowing Aari to place a six screen video game kiosk at
  BART’s Powell Street Station.

The Powell Street BART is my subway stop. Every weekday I stand on that depressing platform at least twice. It is dirty, poorly lit, and loud. The MUNI platform upstairs is even worse, and that is saying something.

When I think of Powell Street Station, to be fair, I am not thinking “fun”, but it wasn’t always this way. Take a little wander back through time with me to San Francisco, mid-1976.



## People Used to Get Bored

Imagine you are waiting for a train. Great, right? You just reach into your pocket and... Now imagine that mobile phones have not been invented. You have 10 minutes with nothing but the voices in your head or maybe, if you're fortunate, some sheets of dead tree carcass with smeary soy-ink words printed on. People used to live like that, and not that long ago.
