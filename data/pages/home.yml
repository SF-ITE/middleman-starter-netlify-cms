  title: JavaScript Dev Diary
story: >-
  The internet is littered with programming tutorials, so why another one? Well, this one's a little different. You see, the person keeping the diary and making the lessons, that would be me, has never written a single line in JavaScript. I want to show you how professional developers learn a new language; how that really works. Because we are all StackOverflow cut and pasters, and that's ok.
